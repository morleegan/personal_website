My website has a navigation bar at the top with four options. Home is the index.html page that has my photo and links
to my other social media accounts and sites. Resume is the resume.html page that was required by the project
specifications. It is laid out similarly to my actual resume but I kept the fonts the same as the rest of the website.
Projects is the page that I want to be able to continue to update. As of now, there are links to my Github and other
accounts but no projects directly on the site. Lastly, the about me page has a summary, highlights and the ability
to get my pdf resume.

The two big things that I would change in my website is layout when you shrink the site and adding projects to the page.
When pages shrink, they sign up on top of each other in an uneven way. I would adapt the way containers/rows to shrink
accordingly. For projects, I think it would be cool to have an element that would show off my art in a nice layout.
In addition it would be nice show my active Github contributions in an interesting way.
